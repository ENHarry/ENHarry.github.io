# About Me!

![](Images/me_allsmiles.jpg)

## Hello technologists and other curious individuals, welcome to my page! 

I'm a data scientist and social entrepreneur, with an MSc in Data Analytics from Fordham University, and I'm in love with the process of finding meaningful insights from data in order to generate profitable business impact and social impact. 

We all have our hobbies, and so like pinky and the brain, in my free time I love to plot ways to take over the world...mwuahahaha!

# Current & Future Projects

Like Pinky and The Brain, I am always working on something new, but unlike them mine actually works....lol.. so stay tuned for more project updates.

### P.S. I am interested in projects that are machine learning/AI driven, and eager to try out experiments using deep and reinforcment learning. Feel free to [contact me](emi.nonye@gmail.com) if you have a project within my scope of interests or if you merely want to pick  my brain for some useful insights on whatever you may be working on.
