# About Me!

![](Images/me_allsmiles.jpg)

## Hello Recruiters and other curious individuals, welcome to my page! 

I'm a Data Scientist, with an MSc in Data Analytics from Fordham University, and I'm in love with the process of finding meaningful insights from data in order to generate profitable business impact and social impact.

We all have our hobbies, and so like pinky and the brain, in my free time I love to plot ways to take over the world...mwuahahaha!
